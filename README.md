52 technologies in 2016
--------

I have taken a challenge to learn a new technology every week in 2016. The goal is to learn a new technology, build a simple application using it, and blog about it.

Below is the list of technologies covered in this series:

1. **[Week 1: January 03, 2016](./01-finatra)** [Finatra - Build Beautiful REST API The Twitter Way](./01-finatra/README.md). In this tutorial, we will learn how to write Scala REST APIs using Twitter's open source framework Finatra. We will build an application from scratch covering all the steps required to build the application.

2. **[Week 2: January 10, 2016](./02-sbt)** [SBT: The Missing Tutorial](./02-sbt/README.md). In this tutorial, we will learn sbt build tool. sbt is a general purpose build tool written in Scala. It is best suited for Scala application development.
